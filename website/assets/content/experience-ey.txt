As a manager-level consultant, I delivered cloud data platforms, DevOps automation, and software engineering solutions to clients in healthcare, insurance, and banking. My work spanned Python, C#, and data engineering—often operating at the intersection of analytics, automation, and platform architecture. I led delivery teams on greenfield cloud data platforms, implemented secure medical imaging pipelines, and introduced modern engineering practices that established structure and predictability within large-scale digital transformations.

Beyond project delivery, I focused on capability building—mentoring distributed teams, shaping DevOps and Git-based workflows, and maintaining technical rigor under demanding timelines. Whether developing anonymisation systems for medical data, automating MRI planning tools, or standardising data pipelines for enterprise clients, my objective remained consistent: combine strong engineering fundamentals with pragmatic delivery leadership that enabled lasting client success.
