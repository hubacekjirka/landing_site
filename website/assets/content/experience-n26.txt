I joined N26 in 2021 at the end of its hyper-growth phase, as the company shifted toward efficiency, optimisation, and scalability. Soon after landing, I began redesigning the data platform components whose earliest design choices could no longer support the volumes and velocity we were seeing.

As a major contributor to the central platform, I led the effort to scale our AWS Redshift estate by splitting the single cluster into a fleet of smaller, domain-aligned units so departments received consistent performance. Along the way I helped pioneer Redshift Data Shares and Redshift Serverless in production—becoming one of the first AWS clients to do so—and later presented the implementation at Redshift Days in Munich.
