In my first consultancy role, I built end-to-end expertise across the SQL Server Data Platform within a firm dedicated to Microsoft technologies. I started with SSIS development, Master Data Services, and SQL programming, later expanding into DBA responsibilities managing over 50 SQL Server instances. I concluded my tenure by designing and implementing highly available SQL Server infrastructures using Always On Availability Groups (SQL Server 2012) and optimising deployments from hardware configuration through to operations. I also contributed to the SQL Server community, delivering a talk on best practices for setup and performance tuning across the full stack.
