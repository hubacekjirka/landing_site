I am a data engineer and developer with 17 years of experience, currently responsible for N26’s data platform. My work here includes architecting and developing the company’s AWS cloud data platform, capable of effectively storing and querying both big and small data and serving over 1,000 internal clients every day.

Before moving in-house, I spent much of the 2010s consulting for EY, Teradata, Think Big and Mercedes-Benz. My engagements span from plan automation for linear accelerators to building integration teams and platforms on greenfield projects, architecting highly available, security-hardened SQL Server clusters, and delivering analytical outcomes for clients such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia, BMW, Audi, Lufthansa, Vodafone, and O2. I love talking to people. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with other team members or junior colleagues.

My go-to stack for data engineering is AWS Cloud, Python, Redshift, Iceberg, S3, Kinesis, Glue, Airflow, Terraform, and Kubernetes. In the past, I worked with Teradata, SQL Server, Tableau, Hadoop, and C#. Outside of work, I enjoy improvisational comedy, scuba diving, and photography, and I continue to explore AI-assisted tooling and this page was assembled with Warp and Codex.
